## How to add new personality
The game's engine allows developer very easy to add new characters. To do so, developer need to properly fill out a new JSON description file, place it in the **heroes_descriptions** directory of the project, and also place an image of the character with the same file name as *description* file to the **heroes_icons** directory. Rebuild the project.
